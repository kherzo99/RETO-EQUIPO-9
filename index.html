            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make 
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
            leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

        Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature 
from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock
